This project is about 'Insurance for Crops'. In real life, some farmers may purchase insurance policies to prevent extreme severe weather affect their revenue from crop products. But sometimes the insurance policies they purchased may take long time to pay them back after certain conditions are met due to human-checking in the process. Moreover, sometimes ambiguities in the policies may even result into interest conflicts between the insurance companies and farmers who purchased the policies.

In my smart contract project, all the policy statements are explicitly written in code. Everyone who would like to purchase the policies can manually examine the source codes. And the contract will automatically execute and pay the insurance policies' buyer the pre-determined cover amount once certain pre-determined thresholds are met.
